Wake up, unwrap presents, have breakfast, watch a movie, visit relatives.
Of course, over time, things have changed slightly. Most notably, the time I wake up, that fact most presents are actually opened the night before, breakfast became brunch and most of my relatives now live a 14-hour flight away.
Movie time didn&amp;rsquo;t change, though, and today&amp;rsquo;s was The Devil Wears Prada.</description></item></channel></rss>
