(The Internet just makes it almost too easy to broadcast this kind of stuff…)

(A post in English for a change over here, because it’s intended for a broad audience)

Whoever I saw or talked to today got thanked personally, but I also got a whole bunch of messages by SMS, IM, Twitter, Facebook, Skype, etc. for my birthday.

To all of those who thought about me today, I want to say **thank you**!

To those who forgot, don’t worry, I know what that’s like. If you think of me today, that’ll do it too :P

To those who don’t care, no hard feelings ;)

To everyone, a little bit of wisdom, which did not come form age, but from [a song](http://www.deezer.com/track/818265):

> Live high, live mighty  
> Live righteously takin’ it easy  
> Live high, live mighty  
> Live righteously
