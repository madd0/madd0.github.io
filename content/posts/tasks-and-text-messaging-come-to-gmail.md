Well, by what I can only hope is coincidence, it would seem that she wasn’t that off-topic after all. Today [Gmail Labs](http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=29418) is launching task lists and text messaging within Gmail.

With a keyboard shortcut to create tasks from mail (Ctrl+T) this is exactly what I needed. Text messaging is a little less useful in my case because they’re unlimited in my plan and you can only send SMS to US numbers, but I guess there’s plenty of people excited about this too ;)

Go to the [Labs tab](https://mail.google.com/mail/#settings/labs) to activate these if you want to take full advantage of your Gmail account.
