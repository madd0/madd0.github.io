[![Imagine Cup Paris-La-Sorbonne jan.29 2008](http://blog.madd0.com/images/WindowsLiveWriter/lang_enGreatpeoplemeetatLaSorbonnelang_e_ED14/IC_121_thumb.jpg)](http://blog.madd0.com/images/WindowsLiveWriter/lang_enGreatpeoplemeetatLaSorbonnelang_e_ED14/IC_121_2.jpg)A few weeks ago I posted the [pictures of the Imagine Cup conference](http://blog.madd0.com/2008/01/30/Photos-with-BillG/?lang=en) that took place in Paris and during which I had the opportunity to interview Bill Gates.

An event like that was of course filmed and now the videos are also available for online viewing and for download from the [web site of Microsoft France](http://www.microsoft.com/france/imagine-cup/conference/).

There are six videos:
