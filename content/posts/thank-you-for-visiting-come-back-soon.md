I regularly check my blog's stats, more for fun and curiosity than for anything else. I like to check who my knowledge (in a very broad sense of the word) might be going to.

This is a map of recent geographic distribution of my visitors that was very pleasant to see by the way:

Obviously, many of the countries that are green only provided one or two visitors, but still, it's nice to see...

As I said on the title of this post: thank you for visiting, I hope you enjoy and come back soon ;)
