For those of you who really appreciate the time gained by not moving your hand away from your keyboard and towards the mouse, Microsoft released 4 keybinding reference cards (cheet sheets if you will) for Visual Studio 2010 in the form of high-quality PDFs.

In these foldable cards youâ€™ll find the default keyboard shortcuts for:

*   Visual Basic .NET
*   Visual C++
*   Visual C#
*   Visual F#
