![windows_sysinternals](http://blog.madd0.com/images/WindowsLiveWriter/lang_enAccessingSysinternalsToolsHasNeve_9127/windows_sysinternals_3.jpg)Do you know the [Sysinternals](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/default.aspx) tools?

You probably do if you're an IT pro or a developer. For those who don't, it's a series of free utilities written by [Mark Russinovich](http://blogs.technet.com/markrussinovich/about.aspx) that are essential to manage, troubleshoot and diagnose your Windows systems and applications. I even need one of the Sysinternals tools for my classes: [ZoomIt](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897434.aspx) allows you to zoom and draw on the screen.

Microsoft acquired Sysinternals some time ago and since then the tools have been available, always for free of course, from the [TechNet website](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/default.aspx). I, like many others, downloaded the whole suite and keep it in USB drives and my "Utils" folder. Even though the website's fine to learn more about each of the individual tools, it's not very practical when it comes to downloading and keeping them up to date.

Fortunately, the Sysinternals Team had the brilliant idea of actually sharing these files like you probably share your files on your home or office network, allowing you to run the tools from any computer connected to the Internet without having to navigate to a webpage, download and extract them. All you have to do is visit [http://live.sysinternals.com/](http://live.sysinternals.com/), which is simply a website with "Directory browsing" on or, even better, use [the direct UNC link](//live.sysinternals.com/Tools/) ([\\live.sysinternals.comTools](//live.sysinternals.com/Tools/)) and run the tools directly. You'll probably want [PowerShell](http://www.microsoft.com/powershell) installed for command line tools then, but those are the exception and all of the Windows apps will execute fine.
