I’ve got plenty of invites for [Joost](http://www.joost.com/) and, this will sound weird, I don’t have enough friends to give them to. So, since Joost is encouraging me to give them away however I want, the first 999 people to request one, will get it. Use the comments.

Here you have their promotion video:

Joost is a way to watch TV on the Internet. Their software is pretty good, unfortunately their content is not. But I hope it will get better as service matures.
