**_Update Those Gaydars_**

Je fais l'effort de transcrire ce sketch de [Mike MacRae](http://www.mikemacrae.com/), mais pas de traduire, désolé ;)

> I used to live in Houston, Texas. Very big gay community down there, a lot of gay bars… A lot of straight people go to the gay bars, but I didn’t know that when I first moved there.
> 
> One time my friends were like “Hey, man, were going over to the, you know, Flip Flop or whatever, come with us.” I was kind of squirrely about it and they were like “Don’t worry, dude, gay people have what they call _gaydar_.”
> 
> Right, you guys have heard this term, _gaydar_. It’s what they call their little ability to tell who’s gay and who’s not gay. It’s like _radar_, but it’s gay, somehow, I guess… And I’m, alright, they’ll just know I’m no gay and they’ll leave me alone, right? Ha, ha— No!
> 
> Apparently a lot of the older dudes are still equipped with, like, old Soviet/Cold War-era gaydar, that they got off the Mujahadin from the black market in the ‘80s or something like that. 'Cause it didn’t really work too well anymore. 'Cause I ended up the night in a sailor suit, crying.
> 
> So, you gotta go with the upgrades on that gaydar. Download them when they come out!
