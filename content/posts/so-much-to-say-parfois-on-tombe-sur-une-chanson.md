**_So Much To Say_**

Parfois on tombe sur une chanson qui dit tout si bien que ce n'est même pas la peine d'essayer de reformuler. Je vous partage donc cet air et vous donne les paroles. Et s'il n'y a que moi qui comprend, ce n'est pas bien grave, ça suffit ;)

> I say my hell is the closet I’m stuck inside  
> Can’t see the light  
> And my heaven is a nice house in the sky  
> Got central heating and I’m alright  
> Yeah, yeah, yeah, can’t see the light  
> Keep it locked up inside don’t talk about it  
> Talk about the weather  
> Yeah, yeah, yeah, can’t see the light  
> Open up my head and let me out, little baby  
> ‘Cause here we have been standing for a long, long time  
> Treading trodden trails for a long, long time
> 
> I say my hell is the closet I’m stuck inside  
> Can’t see the light  
> And my heaven is a nice house in the sky  
> Got central heating and I’m alright  
> 'Cause here we have been standing for a long, long time  
> Treading trodden trails for a long, long time, time, time, time, time, time, time
> 
> I find sometimes it’s easy to be myself  
> Sometimes I find it’s better to be somebody else
> 
> I see you young and soft, oh, little baby  
> Little feet, little hands, little feet, little hands, little baby  
> One year of crying and the words creep up inside  
> Creep into your mind, yeah  
> So much to say, so much to say, so much to say, so much to say  
> So much to say, so much to say, so much to say, so much to say  
> 'Cause here we have been standing for a long, long time  
> Treading trodden trails for a long, long time, time, time, time, time, time, time
> 
> I find sometimes it’s easy to be myself  
> Sometimes I find it’s better to be somebody else
> 
> So much to say, so much to say, so much to say, so much to say  
> So much to say, so much to say, so much to say, so much to say  
> So much to say, so much to say, so much to say, so much to say  
> So much to say, so much to say, so much to say, so much to say
> 
> Open up my head and let me out, little baby
