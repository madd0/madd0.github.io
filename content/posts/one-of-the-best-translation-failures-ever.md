[![translation_failure](http://blog.madd0.com/images/WindowsLiveWriter/lang_enOneoftheBestTranslationFailuresEv_A324/translation_failure_thumb.jpg "translation_failure")](http://blog.madd0.com/images/WindowsLiveWriter/lang_enOneoftheBestTranslationFailuresEv_A324/translation_failure_2.jpg)This one comes straight from Wales, through the [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7702913.stm).

It looks like an innocent street sign, and it is, in English. The problem is that in Wales all street signs must also be displayed in the local language and for that you need a translator. Unfortunately, when consulted for this sign, the translator was out of his office and his automatic reply was used as the actual translation. This is (more or less) what the sign actually says:

> I am not in the office at the moment. Send any work to be translated.
