**_Stay or Leave_**

Je me suis réveillé avec ça dans les oreilles. Je ne ferai pas de long commentaire. Je sais que ce n'est pas un style qui plaît à tout le monde, mais la chanson me rappelle des choses et des personnes, en bien et en mal, et dont je ne vais pas parler. Et j'adore.

Je partage les paroles et vous laisse trouver votre passage préféré :

> Maybe different, but remember  
> Winters warm there you and I,  
> Kissing whiskey by the fire  
> With the snow outside  
> And when the summer comes  
> The river swims at midnight  
> Shiver cold  
> Touch the bottom, you and I,  
> with muddy toes
> 
> Stay or leave  
> I want you not to go  
> But you should  
> It was good, as good goes  
> Stay or leave  
> I want you not to go  
> But you did
> 
> Wake up naked drinking coffee,  
> Making plans to change the world  
> While the world is changing us…  
> It was good good love.  
> You used to laugh under the covers  
> Maybe not so often now  
> But the way I used to laugh with you  
> Was loud and hard
> 
> Stay or leave  
> I want you not to go  
> But you should  
> It was good as good goes  
> Stay or leave  
> I want you not to go  
> But you did
> 
> So what to do  
> With the rest of today’s afternoons, hey  
> Isn’t it strange how we change  
> Everything we did  
> Did I do all that I should
> 
> That I could'a done
> 
> Remember we used to dance  
> And everyone wanted to be  
> You and me  
> I want to be too  
> What day is this  
> Besides the day you left me?  
> What day is this  
> Besides the day you went?
> 
> So what to do  
> With the rest of the day’s afternoons, hey  
> Well isn’t it strange how we change  
> Everything we did  
> Did I do all that I could?
> 
> Remember we used to dance  
> And everyone wanted to be you and me  
> I want to be too  
> What day is this?  
> Besides the day you left me  
> What day is this?
