Since [Patrice](http://blogs.developpeur.org/patrice/archive/2007/02/21/misc-i-ve-been-tagged.aspx) tagged me, I guess it’s my geek duty to share 5 things people don’t know about me with whatever stranger stumbles upon my blog (and the few regular readers.)

I’ll need a moment to think though, because if there are aspects of my life that are not public it’s probably because I like them that way.

There’s a trip to China coming up soon (Saturday), so I’ll have some time to think then.
