Je n'aurais jamais cru citer Ashton Kutcher, mais son discours aux _Teen Choice Awards 2013_ ne me laisse pas indifférent. Alors, avant que les dieux du _copyright_ ne suppriment la vidéo attachée à ce billet, je retranscris ce qu'il a dit (en tout cas, la partie intéressante, mais en anglais, faut pas abuser) :

> \[T\]here are some really amazing things that I learned \[…\] and I wanted to share \[…\] with you guys, because I think it’s helped me be here today.
> 
> It’s really three things: the first thing is about **opportunity**, the second thing is about **being sexy**, and the third thing is about **living life**.
> 
> First, **opportunity**: I believe that opportunity looks a lot like hard work. When I was 13 I had my first job with my dad carrying shingles up to the roof. And then I got a job washing dishes at a restaurant. And then I got a job in a grocery store deli. And then I got a job in a factory sweeping Cheerio dust off the ground. And **I’ve never had a job in my life, that I was better than**. I was always just lucky to have a job. And every job I had was a stepping stone to my next job, and I never quit my job until I had my next job. And so, **opportunities look a lot like work**.
> 
> Number two, being sexy: **the sexiest thing in the entire world is being really smart, and being thoughtful, and being generous**. And everything else is crap! I promise you! It’s just crap that people try to sell to you to make you feel like less, so don’t buy it! **Be smart. Be thoughtful. And be generous.**
> 
> The third thing is something that I just relearned when I was making this movie about Steve Jobs: Steve Jobs said, when you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way that it is. And that your life is to live your life inside the world, try not to get into too much trouble and, maybe, get an education, and get a job and make some money and have a family… But life can be a lot broader than that when you realize one simple thing and that is that **everything around us, that we call life, was made up by people that are no smarter than you**. And you can build your own things. You can build your own life that other people can live in.
> 
> **So, build a life, don’t live one. Build one!**
> 
> **Find your opportunities!**
> 
> **And always be sexy!**

**(Emphasis mine)**
