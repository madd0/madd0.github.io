It was like a 1000 degrees in [Kuala Lumpur](http://www.flickr.com/photos/madd0/sets/72157618540341945/) today! OK, I may be exaggerating, I think it was an average of about 32° with a maximum of about 35°.

Still, that didn’t stop me from [walking around the city](http://www.flickr.com/photos/madd0/3557289059/in/set-72157618540341945/). Yes, **walking**! I was sweating like \[_insert whatever you think sweats the most in the world here_\], but I really don’t see how you else you can enjoy a city.

The more I walked around the city, the more I liked it and its people. Even around 1 or 2 p.m. when I was pushing my way through the crowded hawker-filled alleys of [Little India](http://www.flickr.com/photos/madd0/3558161404/in/set-72157618540341945/) it didn’t feel as bad or as uncomfortable as _Avenida Central_ or _rue de Rivoli_.

And the people are just so friendly; I can’t even remember how many times I got stopped today, just for a few minutes of friendly chat! I remember this Malay lady right outside the Petronas Towers, who asked my where I came from, since “my skin color didn’t look Malaysian”. There was also this Filipino guy, who wanted to know where I bought my shorts; he looked a little disappointed when I told him it came from Costa Rica. I also got my fortune told by an Indian man, for free! He said I was surely very lucky and he talked about this one very good friend I have to take care of. It’s probably just generic stuff, but it sounded quite right to me ;)

[Food-wise, I’m in paradise](http://www.flickr.com/photos/madd0/3558102830/in/set-72157618540341945/)! There’s just so much choice and so varied, I don’t even know where to start. I know this morning I discovered my new favorite drink: _teh ais_. I soon as I stop chugging them like they’re going to run out, I’ll take a picture to show you what they look like, although you really have to taste to understand.

Finally, as if the day’s heat hadn’t been enough, right when I was getting ready to do some [night photography of the the KLCC area](http://www.flickr.com/photos/madd0/3557382577/in/set-72157618540341945/), it started pouring like I hadn’t seen in a while; like I hadn’t seen since… well I’m not sure if my last downpour was in [Costa Rica](http://www.flickr.com/photos/madd0/3114431306/) or in [Seoul](http://www.flickr.com/photos/madd0/1091799457/). My tropical upbringing was enough to know that there was nothing to panic about, though. I went out to take a few “[wet pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/madd0/3557370641/in/set-72157618540341945/)” and then waited for the rain to pass while planning my trip to the Perhentian Islands.

Today’s disappointment was not being able to go up the [Petronas Towers](http://www.flickr.com/photos/madd0/3557273397/in/set-72157618540341945/). Apparently you have to be there extra early to get in. I guess that’s what happens when stuff is free. I did get to go up [Menara KL](http://www.flickr.com/photos/madd0/3557294341/in/set-72157618540341945/) though, where I saw a few [animals that reminded me of one or two friends](http://www.flickr.com/photos/madd0/3558106544/in/set-72157618540341945/) ;) and even got to [play with a reptile](http://www.flickr.com/photos/madd0/3557307797/in/set-72157618540341945/) or [two](http://www.flickr.com/photos/madd0/3558129634/in/set-72157618540341945/).

Tomorrow’s plans? To get to the Petronas Towers very early in the morning in order to go up to the Skybridge. I haven’t thought much about the rest of the day yet, though. I’m already looking forward to a few days at the beach. And I leave you with a message I found while walking around:
