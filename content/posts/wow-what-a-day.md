In the good sense of course… Today was a great **day**! It was a **day** of discovery, of rediscovery, of new things in general.

So, what’s all the excitement about?, you might wonder. Well, let’s see, more or less in order:

I might be onto a gig in Malaysia, how cool is that?

I was one of the winners of the Trick-or-Treat category in [MAKE](http://www.makezine.com)’s Halloween contest! I get the latest issue of MAKE magazine. [Check out all the other winners in all categories](http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2006/11/make_craft_hall.html). Next year, the Hack-o-Lantern will be mine :)

I installed Simon’s [newest release of My Exposé](http://blogs.labo-dotnet.com/simon/archive/2006/11/08/11485.aspx) for Windows Vista. It’s a CTP (Community Technical Preview), but it’s pretty stable and bug-free. It features a new placement algorithm, way more organic than the original grid placement. An improved trigger interface, so that you can write your own triggers. As a matter of fact, it comes with a new trigger for Voice activation and control (of which I wrote a first version, but Simon pretty much rewrote it afterwards). Oh, and it also comes with extremely cool icons, made by yours truly ;)

Last week I was notified that I had won a book, _two_ books actually, on [Certifdotnet](http://www.certifdotnet.com/), by getting a top score last month. Both books arrived today: [_Ajax : le guide complet_](http://www.amazon.fr/exec/obidos/ASIN/2742968288/themadd0mall-21) and _[XAML](http://www.amazon.fr/exec/obidos/ASIN/274296729X/themadd0mall-21)_, which happens to be part of the same collection as [my own book](http://www.amazon.fr/exec/obidos/ASIN/2742968261/themadd0mall-21). (Yes, all in French, sorry)

I got the [serial cable for my Lego Mindstorms](http://cgi.ebay.fr/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=6066992547) yesterday. I can’t believe how hard it is to get the right serial cable these days. What’s worse, it’s also hard to connect it to a “modern” laptop computer, since they don’t have serial ports any more. But no worries, I borrowed a RS232-USB converter from a friend (who will remain anonymous, just in case ;) ) and, after recharging and buying batteries today, I got to use my [RCX](http://mindstorms.lego.com/eng/default_ris.asp) again after about 3 years (OK, I’ll admit I could’ve looked harder…).

So, I’m geek enough that playing with Legos (albeit very technological and not-necessarily-childish Legos) is already exciting, I went ahead and downloaded and installed [Microsoft’s Robotics Studio November 2006 CTP](http://www.microsoft.com/robotics). Yet another CTP, but this one, sorry Simon, is way cooler that My Exposé. I guess the “new technology” factor + the “moving creations” one makes it more exciting. The only feature I’ve tried for now is the [Visual Programming Language](http://msdn.microsoft.com/robotics/learn/VPLTutorials/default.aspx) (VPL), which allows you to program your robots using drag & drop, but that was enough. I can’t wait to play with simulator and the runtime. I think it’s safe to say that this weekend I’ll be playing with Legos quite a lot :)

Finally, just before starting this post, I learnt that [Photosynth](http://labs.live.com/photosynth/), from [Live Labs](http://labs.live.com/), is now live! Well, a preview is live… If you don’t know what it is, I suggest to get my [OPML file](http://www.opmlmanager.com/opml/madd0.opml) and subscribe to most of the feeds to stay informed and/or [click here for their explanation](http://labs.live.com/photosynth/whatis/). There’s also [videos here](http://labs.live.com/photosynth/video.html).

Well, I guess that’s pretty much all. Sure it might not be everybody’s idea of an exciting **day**, but then again, it’s not everybody’s blog ;)

Oh yeah, and I won 25 cents at poker, which doesn’t seem much, but I actually doubled my stack :)
