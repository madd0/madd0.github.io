As you probably read before in my blog, I’ve had a crippled version of Windows Vista since I installed it. Microsoft calls it the “N” version.

Well, as of yesterday, my Windows is complete!

Microsoft is pushing the _Nsku Media Restore Pack for Vista x86 (KB925749)_ through Windows Update. A “recommended” update described as:

> Media Restore Pack (MRP) and Format Restore Pack (FRP) are non-discoverable, regulated releases required to satisfy consent decree agreements for Windows sale in certain markets. MRP and FRP restore media capability to Windows Nsku (including KN).

This means, I finally get Windows Media Player and Windows Movie Maker.

I don’t really care for WMM, but I’ve been waiting for Media Player for a long time. :)
