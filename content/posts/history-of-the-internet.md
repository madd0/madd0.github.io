Very nice video created by [Melih Bilgil](http://www.lonja.de) as part of his diploma project [PICOL](http://www.picol.org) illustrating the history of the Internet from 1957 to 1990.

He uses the icons of his design to represent every element of the story. That and a well written voice over, make for a very interesting, easy to understand video. I’m actually considering asking my teachers to play this as an introduction to our web development classes.

Noticed the music by [Matthias Grübel](http://www.telekaster.net/)? I liked it a lot. Click on his name to visit his very weird web site, filled with photos and poetry, or go visit his [myspace profile for more music](http://www.myspace.com/telekastermusiken).
