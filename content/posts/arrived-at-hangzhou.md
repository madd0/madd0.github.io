2009-05-22 05:00 GMT+8 Arrived at Hangzhou about 20 minutes ago. After a noisy arrival, it was taxi to Xi Hu, the West Lake. There’s already plenty of people here; jogging, doing t'ai chi, shouting, jumping, … I have a few hours before I leave for the airport. I will probably walk around the lake a bit and then look for an Internet connexion. After all, I still don’t have a bed in KL.
