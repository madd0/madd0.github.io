Yahoo! co-founder and Microsoft hero\*, Jerry Yang is standing down from his position as CEO of one of the Internet’s biggest portals.

I know I have a résumé some around here… jobs@yahoo.com, you said? And the subject line? :P

\* Microsoft offered $33/share a few months ago and Yang refused to sell. Today Yahoo! shares are so close to $10 that it's hard not to cry (or quit).
