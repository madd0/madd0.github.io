Hi,

I just read about an alarming new study. It found that deaths from falls among older adults in the U.S. has significantly increased. In fact, among seniors 75 and older there were three times more deaths from falls in 2016 than in 2000.

Iâ€™d like to write an article for your readers about fall prevention best practices that can help seniors age in place safely. In it, I can cover a variety of topics, including which home modifications help prevent falls, tips on lifestyle changes that aid in fall prevention, and more.

The article will be free and completely original. If youâ€™re open to receiving an article, please let me know.
