A classic to remember [George Carlin](http://www.georgecarlin.com/), who [died last night](http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1817175,00.html?xid=rss-topstories) of heart failure.

Reader beware, this is probably considered by some as not work safe and especially not appropriate for children.

I leave you to (re)enjoy the “The Seven Words You Can Never Say On TV.”

Since I’ll probably watch this stuff all morning, I might be posting other videos later. If you’re curious, check out [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/profile_play_list?user=DiavoloDiAno).
