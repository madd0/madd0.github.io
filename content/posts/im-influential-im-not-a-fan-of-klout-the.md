_**I’m Influential!**_

I’m not a fan of [Klout](http://klout.com), the Internet’s latest virtual penis ruler in vogue, I find it useless.

Then again, they seem to know pretty interesting stuff about me that I don’t know myself. Case in point, the image above: I’m influential in Washington!

It would seems that I’m also influential about Adobe and France. The latter, I get, the former, I have no idea how they came to that conclusion…

Anyway, at least it makes me laugh :)
