Whats up with best browser, browsers are becoming unimportant, its the content and the applications that counts in my opinion and neither Fox or IE or Other Browser people are thinking about this. I personally use the Gluon Browser, which is by the way the only browser that offers Online Applications.

You did get the fact that this was all a joke right? All Long's script does is tell you that your current browser is the best browser ever :P
