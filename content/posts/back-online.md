So, I don't really know when this will be true because it will depend on the time the new IP address replicates through DNS, but still, I'm back online!

So, my previous host lost most of my data. I will slowly restore/rewrite as much as I can.

For now, enjoy the new look and new engine, of which I will probably be writing in the following weeks as I develop it further with my friend [Patrice](http://patricelamarche.net/).
