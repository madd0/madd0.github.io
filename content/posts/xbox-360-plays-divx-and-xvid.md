[![Xbox 360 Controller](http://blog.madd0.com/images/WindowsLiveWriter/lang_enXbox360PlaysDivXandXviDlang_enlan_501/xbox_360_controller_thumb.jpg)](http://blog.madd0.com/images/WindowsLiveWriter/lang_enXbox360PlaysDivXandXviDlang_enlan_501/xbox_360_controller_2.jpg)Finally! With today's update, the Xbox 360 is now able to read DivX and XviD files (which you naturally acquired legally).

As soon as I heard about this, I of course turned on the beast and downloaded the necessary files (you need the new Xbox software _and_ the codecs, which are downloaded separately).

It all works almost perfectly on my setup, which is a [TVersity](http://www.tversity.com/home) server streaming to the Dashboard on a PIII 500 MHz, 128 MB RAM. You'll guess that the "almost" comes from my hardware which sometimes has trouble keeping up :)

The only problem is that, for some reason, this doesn't work if you're using the Xbox as a Media Center Extender. But since this doesn't concern me directly right now, I'll just wait for the next software upgrade. Hopefully, I'll have performed a hardware upgrade by then.
