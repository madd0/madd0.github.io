So, as you may have noticed, although the French team didn't qualify for the Software Design category, it still went home victorious with 4 other trophies!

I'm also very happy for the Jamaicans who won 3rd place in Software Design since they were representing Central America and the Caribbean, so in a certain sense, they were my team :)

Something else you may have noticed is that my name is not on the list. This was kind of expected since I never really finished the application I submitted for Round 2 of the competition, but it's still a bummer. On the bright side, I get to participate next year on whatever category I want.

And where will we compete next year?

In case the Eiffel Tower and the Arc du Triomphe were not enough clues, the location is France. The finals of Imagine Cup 2008 will be in Paris, France, in July 2008. I'll definitively be there. Hopefully as a finalist.

So there you go. I still have a couple of posts about Imagine Cup and Seoul left to write, and then the blog will go back to normal.
