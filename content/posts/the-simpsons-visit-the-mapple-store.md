In the latest Simpsons episode, the family visits the new Mapple Store at the mall.

I don’t know how long the video will stay online, but it’s just great!

I had never visited an Apple Store before my trip to London at the beginning of the month, but I found it was really fun; it felt like visiting the HQ of the Church of Scientology for some reason :P

Anyway, enjoy the fist few minutes of perfect Simpsons sarcasm.
