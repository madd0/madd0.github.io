So, here I am, preparing to go back to Paris. And, by preparing, I mean I’m already at the airport in San José where they do offer free WiFi (unlike [Barajas](http://blog.madd0.com/2007/02/28/crossing-oceans-part-i/)).

There was lots of work to do last week: a full schedule of meetings last Monday and Tuesday and after that, a less-full schedule of family to meet until today, as well as a passport to make. I’ll be talking about the passport later this week (or in a couple of weeks, we’ll see) in order to put the “tech” back in my blog.

I don’t have much more to say about my visit to Costa Rica. I really enjoyed the 27+ °C every day, the pool, Taco Bell, Quiznos, 27+ °C, the pool :)

Oh, and there’s the fact that I’m in the VIP Lounge in Juan Santamaría Airport (that’s the name of the airport in San José) and I don’t really know why. I somehow got an upgrade for the crossing of the Atlantic.

Well, I’ll be showing you my passport as soon as I get my hands on a camera to take a couple of pictures. There’s also a couple of code snippets in C# I’d like to show you. In short, I hope I’ll be writing for frequently than once a month…
