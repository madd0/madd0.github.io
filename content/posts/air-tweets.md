It has been suggested that I’m addicted to [Twitter](http://twitter.com/madd0). This is, of course, nonsense, as evidenced by [my stats](http://www.tweetstats.com/graphs/madd0) ;)

If I were addicted to Twitter, however, Lufthansa’s [MySkyStatus](http://myskystatus.com/) is _the_ Twitter/Facebook app I’d be really looking forward to use. Actually, who am I kidding? The only reason I haven’t actually used it is because I have no plans to get on a plane anytime soon.

So, what’s it all about?

As you probably know, for more or less invalid reasons, planes do not provide Internet access. This means that you can be trapped for _hours_ inside a metal tube **without being able to tell the world what you’re doing in 140 characters or less!**  As I see it, this is torture for yourself and for your followers, who will not be able to follow your every move. In comes MySkyStatus.

While you’re in the air, sweating and scratching, MySkyStatus will send **altitude, location, departure and arrival updates** automatically to your Facebook and/or Twitter pages.

This, of course, is about as useful as a Nabaztag—unless you’re a kidnapper and you’re victim’s using the service—but, I admit, I really wish I could take the plane soon, just to test it.

The service is obviously free an works with pretty much any airline and any flight. So go ahead and try it; I’ll follow on Twitter to see if it works ;)
