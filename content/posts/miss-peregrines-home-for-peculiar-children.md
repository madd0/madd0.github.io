It turns out it's originally a book, so I went over to Amazon, downloaded the first few pages and ended up buying the whole thing. It's exactly the kind of fantastic universe I like to immerse myself into.

The [Kindle version that I bought](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B00SPV9B7Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=madd0-france-21&linkId=04f58bd7becc2f5e0036fc9758f78218) included three novels actually: _Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children_ and its two sequels, _Hollow City_ and _Library of Souls_. I liked the first one a lot, enjoyed the second one OK, but just wanted to get through the third one to see how the story ended. This seems to happen to me often with series that had a successful first book or first few books, but where you can feel that either pressure from success and/or from the editors drives the sequels rather than a well told story…

I already noticed from the trailer that the movie is a loose adaptation of the books. I just hope it tells the whole story (which can definitely be told in less than 2 hours), rather than try to capitalise on multiple films. But still, I have a feeling that it will be way better in my head, despite Burton's talent.

I particularly enjoyed the fact that the author went through the trouble of making the books themselves peculiar by using unusual photographs to illustrate (and kind of drive) the story. If you like reading stories of adolescents with special powers running around the UK and through time, the books are really enjoyable and a quick read, so I strongly recommend them.
