Finally, after who-knows-how-many years (2-3?) of developing and using amazOOP, I got a real incentive to keep working on it: my fist Amazon cheque!!!

It's from Amazon.de, which ironically was the last affiliate programme I subscribed to, but who cares...

I just hope the other Amazons will follow the German example soon ;)
