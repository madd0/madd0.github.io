It has happened, my Office Professional 2007 trial has expired… And entering a new Trial key did not extend my trial period for another 60 days :(

If only I could get my hands on one of the at least two keys I legally have the right to (one from MSDN and one from helping out during the TechDays.)

I do have to congratulate Microsoft on the way they are managing licensing with Office 2007, though. Although my trial has expired, I can still use Office. My computer didn’t blow up and I’m not required to uninstall. I can still read documents with Word, check e-mail with Outlook, print spreadsheets with Excel, and so on. Sure, I can’t create new files or e-mails, or save modifications to existing files, but hey, I might even manage to work like this until I get a license (although I doubt it…)
