Well, I didn't think an escalator needed one, but the numbers seem to say different:

For those who can't read the poor quality text, it says "Last year: 1,024 injuries".

The number drew my attention for two reasons:

1.  What are the probabilities of the number of injuries on escalators being a power of 2?
2.  How can there be almost 3 injuries per day on something as trivial as an escalator? (that's an [interrobang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang), in case you're wondering)

Sure, the escalators on the London tube can be impressive:

But still...
