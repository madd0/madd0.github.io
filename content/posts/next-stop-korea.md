[![Imagine Cup Korea 2007](http://blog.madd0.com/images/WindowsLiveWriter/lang_enNextstopKorealang_enlang_frProcha_14DA9/imaginecup_thumb.png)](http://blog.madd0.com/images/WindowsLiveWriter/lang_enNextstopKorealang_enlang_frProcha_14DA9/imaginecup.png)I left some IE7 tabs open before I took the plane to Costa Rica and, while closing them today, I stumbled upon [Channel 8](http://channel8.msdn.com/) again, where a new video is already online. This video, that presents Bill Gates and Craig Mundie talking about [Imagine Cup](http://imaginecup.com/), reminded me that I forgot to make a very important announcement because it happened right when my blog died:

I qualified for the Imagine Cup finals in Korea!

Well, when I say _I_, I mean my team of course, [Time Cube](http://imaginecup.com/MyStuff/MyTeam.aspx?TeamID=4904). So I leave for Korea with the rest of the French finalists on the 4th of August to participate in the final event of the Interface Design category. We'll see how it goes.

Wish me luck!
