**_Procrastination Equation_**

*   _U_ = Utility (desire to finish a task)
*   _E_ = Expectation of success
*   _V_ = Value of completion
*   _I_ = Immediacy of the task
*   _D_ = Personal sensitivity to dely

I have to figure out whatâ€™s wrong with my numbers, but right now, _U_ tends very strongly towards 0 over here :/
