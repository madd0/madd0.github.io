Hello, I tried to use your linqpad driver for azure table. The only thing i get is 'Error: Primary and secondaray location URIS in a StorgaeUri must point to the same resource.' On the window to connect , i thought you have just to give the 'URI' and the primary key. Could you explain what information we need to provide? Thanks AUTHOR: dom AUTHOR EMAIL: dominique.chetboune@interact-software.com AUTHOR URL: SUBJECT: \[madd0's tech blog\] Contact IP: 93.9.10.11 Array ( \[1\_Name\] => dom \[2\_Email\] => dominique.chetboune@interact-software.com \[3\_Website\] => \[4\_Message\] => Hello, I tried to use your linqpad driver for azure table.
