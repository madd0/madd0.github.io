[Sitepoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/) is [giving away](http://twitaway.com) its book [_The Art & Science of CSS_](http://www.sitepoint.com/books/cssdesign1/) during a two-week “Twitaway” (5 days left as of the writing of this post).

The book looks pretty interesting from what I browsed when I got it a few minutes ago, so I actually recommend it at least as a quick reference for some pretty useful CSS techniques.

What do you have to do to get it? This is where it gets interesting:

Follow [@sitepointdotcom](mailto:f@sitepointdotcom) on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/)\*! You’ll get a DM with instructions on how to get it.

I’m quite a fan of Twitter (you can [follow me](http://twitter.com/madd0) if you want), so I really like the idea. If you’re worried about your “stats”, don’t: @sitepointdotcom will follow you back :P And if you’re worried about spam, you can always stop following the account with a single click ;)

\* If you don’t have a Twitter account (although I really encourage you to [create one](http://twitter.com/signup), you might like it) you can also get the [instructions by e-mail](http://twitaway.com).
