I don’t know how long the video will stay online, but it’s just great!
I had never visited an Apple Store before my trip to London at the beginning of the month, but I found it was really fun; it felt like visiting the HQ of the Church of Scientology for some reason :P
Anyway, enjoy the fist few minutes of perfect Simpsons sarcasm.</description></item><item><title>You’re invited!</title><link>/2007/05/09/yoursquore-invited/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 May 2007 13:09:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2007/05/09/yoursquore-invited/</guid><description>I’ve got plenty of invites for Joost and, this will sound weird, I don’t have enough friends to give them to.

Here you have their promotion video:
Joost is a way to watch TV on the Internet. Their software is pretty good, unfortunately their content is not.</description></item></channel></rss>
